/* Note: The only files that I have managed to make it OOP approach are:

CharacterCreation.java now has different java classes added:
- ChooseJob.java
- ChooseName.java


EldenRogue.java has been changed
TitleScreen.java (Now includes a new java class named UserInput.java. This UserInput class will be used on other java files as well)

GameLobby now has dfferent java files added:
- FastTravel.java
- LevelUp.java

There are logical errors/bugs as of this implementation:

- In AREA_1, if the player tile "goes to the door tile "D", it will go straight to the next floor instead of cancelling it out by not pressing "E".


===========================================
Also note: the only files I didn't touch are GameLobby.java and Item.java because it might lead to more conflicting errors

So what I did is to create GameLobby (Andre's version where you will merge it).java.

We still need to make it oop approach so lets keep up the grind!
